                        Diabetes is one of the metabolic diseases whereby the level of blood sugar in the body rises due to inadequate production of insulin in the body or when the body cells fail to respond to the insulin. Apparently, this disease prevalence is very high. For instance, about 9% of the total population in the USA is living with this disease. However, findings show that the choices you make about what goes into your body contribute greatly in either reducing or increasing the risk of getting diabetes. Below are some of the food that should be included in your diet to reduce this risk.
